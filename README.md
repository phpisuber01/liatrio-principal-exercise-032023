# Liatrio Principal Interview Exercise

## Executive Summary
XYZ is a very popular digital publication ecommerce platform, serving millions of customers worldwide. Although XYZ has been successful with serving its customers it has been at great expense and challenge from the technology side. Increasing customer consumption, ever-changing ways people consume products and the competitors in the market demand that we improve our processes and availability to remain relevant.

Through some initial discovery and collaboration between Liatrio and XYZ, we have identified some key pain points that can be addressed with cloud modernization and migration.
* Regular downtime that impacts revenue due to customers being unable to make purchases;
* Long process times and deployment times which slow our ability to deploy new features and improvements;
* Frequent defects and performance problems that plague our support teams and customers, again preventing the capture of revenue and increasing costs;
* A lack of innovation due to prohibitive processes and hardware availability that prevent new ideas from being explored in a timely manner.

Liatrio proposes a cloud modernization solution that will quickly resolve these concerns by embedding a highly skilled team of cloud consultants with XYZ’s leadership and development teams. Throughout our engagement, we will work with the business to identify process improvements and help to ease constraints on the development team to improve their capabilities. In addition, we will embed our team with the developers to move these critical workloads into a cloud platform in a manner consistent with industry standards – which allow for fast, repeatable and consistent results.

In order to demonstrate these commitments, as well as make some immediate positive impact to your business, we will start with a “lighthouse” project. Our first engagement will target a medium complexity, business critical application to modernize and migrate into the cloud – achieving improvements in the above pain points – and rapidly upskilling that development team. As we learn more about XYZ’s business, process and people, we can then build a strategy to scale this work up into the other products and services by conducting an inventory of applications and grouping like-applications together to improve velocity and manage risk.

Throughout this lighthouse, and eventually the larger engagement, we aim to achieve the following objectives as a measure of your success:
* **Achieve Continuous Delivery** - Allowing your teams to deploy new features and improvements at any time and as frequently as needed.
* **Improve Consistency** - Deploy identical environments and implement code quality checks to ensure defects do not go into production.
* **Optimize Processes** - Working with your leaders and managers to reduce process overhead and improve feedback loops.
* **Eliminate Downtime** - Implement industry standard deployment strategies to completely remove downtime during your deployments and maintenance, allowing customers to continue shopping.
* **Leverage Containerization** - Modernize existing application architectures into container-based models that improve availability and efficiency.
* **Create Self-Service Tools** - Enable teams to innovate and experiment by streamlining the process of launching a new environment.

Lastly, and most importantly, we’re committed to upskilling you and your teams by involving them in the discovery, design and development of all of these objectives. Our job isn’t done until your teams can maintain, deploy and develop new products using these improved processes and tools.

We expect this lighthouse engagement to consist of one principal, one senior and two staff consultants and take about 8 weeks to complete. Let’s get to work.
